# ultrahelper Pose Module Enhancements
#### 3. Split `ModifiedPose` into deployable components

This update refactors the original `ModifiedPose` head to support hardware/CPU split and adds 4D‑tensor monitoring hooks.

## Changes in `pose.py`

### 1. Split into Head & Postprocessor

- **Original**: Single `ModifiedPose(Pose)` class with `forward(x)`.
- **Updated**: Two-stage pipeline:
  - `forward_head(x)` runs all convolutional layers and detection logic on the hardware (GPU/MPS).
  - `forward_postprocessor(head_out)` runs view/reshape, keypoint decoding, and any non‑4D ops on the CPU.

```diff
- def forward(self, x):
-     return super().forward(x)
+ def forward(self, x):
+     feats = self.forward_head(x)
+     return self.forward_postprocessor(feats)
```

### 2. 4D‑Tensor Monitoring

To identify any operations that still handle 4D tensors (and might not be supported on targeted hardware), we introduce a small hook utility:

```python
from ..utils.monitor_4d import monitor_4d_ops
```

- Wrap any method with `with monitor_4d_ops(self):` to log every leaf layer (`Conv2d`, `BatchNorm2d`, `SiLU`, etc.) that sees a 4D tensor.
- Example in postprocessor:

```python
with monitor_4d_ops(self):
    feats, det_out, bs = x
    ...
```

## Usage

From your project root (e.g. `mentium`), run:

```bash
# Enable 4D‑tensor monitoring during training
monitor_4d_ops=1 python -m ultrahelper --train
```

- The `monitor_4d_ops=1` environment variable is just a reminder—in practice the Python code wraps the hook context directly. If you want to instrument both head and postprocessor, ensure the `with monitor_4d_ops(...)` context is placed around both calls.

## Why These Changes?

- **Hardware Constraints**: Some target accelerators only support 4D tensors through convolution layers. By pushing all conv layers into `forward_head`, we maximize hardware utilization.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Non‑4D ops (reshape, flatten, keypoint decoding) live in `forward_postprocessor` on CPU where they won’t block or crash the accelerator.
- **Debugging**: The 4D‑monitor lets you catch any accidental 4D tensor usage outside of the hardware stage.

Feel free to adapt the placement of `monitor_4d_ops` guards to cover any other custom modules or methods you add.
